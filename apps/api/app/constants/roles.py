    """Roles a user can hold within an organization.

    Role-model redesign (2026-06-23). Target vocabulary:

    - ``operations_admin`` — CheckWise superadmin. Everything, and the ONLY
      role that may create users, assign/change roles, grant admins, run
      feedback triage, and set a client's review mode.
    - ``platform_admin`` — CheckWise review team. Approve/deny documents for
      all clients & providers, add clients + providers, READ the audit log.
      May NOT manage users/roles. Absorbs the retired ``internal_admin``
      compliance surface and the retired ``reviewer`` queue.
    - ``client_admin`` — per-tenant Approver, CheckWise-granted only. Adds
      providers + (when its client is in self-review mode — Phase 3) approves
      / denies that client's documents; manages its own ``client_viewer``
      seats (cap 3).
    - ``client_viewer`` — per-tenant read + export oversight seat.
    - ``provider`` — vendor upload (a workspace session, not a Membership).

    ``Membership.role`` is a free string column, so the rename is a data
    migration (0056). ``INTERNAL_ADMIN`` and ``REVIEWER`` are retained below
    as DEPRECATED members for the transition window only: the migration
    rewrites every row off them and they are removed once a grep confirms
    zero references. Do not gate new code on them — use ``STAFF_ROLES`` /
    ``SUPERADMIN_ROLES``.
